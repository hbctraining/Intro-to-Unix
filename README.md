## Introduction to shell and high-performance computing (HPC)

### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a 2-day introduction to shell (bash) and high-performance computing with a brief introduction to RNA-sequencing data analysis. It is intended to give participants without any computational skills the ability to effectively use an high-performance compute environment ([HMS-RC]()) to analyze data. This workshop focuses on implementing the workflow to analyze RNA-seq data, starting with raw FASTQs and ending with generation of counts. 

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.

### Learning Objectives

1.	Understand the necessity for, and use of, the command line interface (bash) and HPC for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data.
2.	Understand best practices for designing an RNA-seq experiment and analysis the resulting data.
